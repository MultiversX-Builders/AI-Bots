We all do love #SovereignShards and we have received a lot of questions regarding the economics:

1. How do I become a validator?
2. What are the benefits of Sovereign Shards on the economics model of the mainchain?
3. What is the trust model of Sovereign Shards?

The economics design for complex systems is rather important and we can create a framework where it is easy to launch custom appchains which inherit as much trust as possible. 

The key words here are : dual staking, shared security and increased trust

Developers who want to create smart contract protocols like DEXs, lending platforms, and more on #MultiversX can benefit from the security of MultiversX’s network by simply deploying their contracts on it. This has enabled a rapid and diverse growth of innovative smart contract protocols on a secure platform, such as #DeFi, #NFTs, and more.

However, one of the biggest challenge for a new project launching a SovereignShard is the fact that is has to build their own trust network from scratch to get any security. This is probably the biggest challenge for every new idea to overcome the same challenge that hinders innovation in distributed systems from achieving a similar level of speed, variety, and scale as innovation in smart contract protocols.

Proof of Stake (PoS) is a way of providing some services to its users by a network. Users request tasks, and the network gives appropriate responses. The user then can check that the network response has met some quorum rules. Using Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT), a common user task might be to include a transaction. Here, a valid response would be a block that contains the transaction, supported by signatures from at least two-thirds of the operators.

Problem:
However, starting a new Proof-of-Stake (PoS) network is difficult. It usually involves creating a new token and convincing people to buy and stake the token. These native tokens are often unstable, causing high inventory risk for holders. These native tokens might also be hard to get because of their newness and lack of exchange listings.

Imagine a world where you could access the security and trust features of MultiversX programmatically according to the needs of your custom systems, being it in this case the Sovereign Shards. Furthermore, by tapping into this design, SovereignShards could enjoy shared security, bigger economic trust and more selection on the Validators. In this world, developers would not have to worry about creating a trust network from scratch. Instead, they could design systems that pay fees to the programmable network to get the amount of security they need, in order to build innovative systems.

Solution: Dual Staking with ReStaking
Dual staking uses two tokens to secure the same PoS network. If one of these tokens is an external network token with lower volatility, higher liquidity, and more access, such as $EGLD, it could solve the problems new PoS networks face. Dual staking makes the bootstrapping process easier. Instead of requiring stakers to hold an unstable new token, they can stake $EGLD into the network. Along with staking $EGLD, stakers can also stake the network’s native token. Dual staking also reduces the “death spiral” effect. If the native token’s price declines, the PoS network’s security is still impacted, but the effect is limited. This is because the EGLD staked in the PoS network provides a basic economic security.

To further enhance the design, the $EGLD does not need to be used directly, but a liquid staked format of it will be accepted, effectively creating incentives/stable income for all who enter the Sovereign ecosystem as well. This is what we can call reStaking. With this,  Sovereign Shards can tap into the already existing economic and decentralized trust of existing validators and new economics models can be hooked to it instantly. Finally, using this framework a complex shared security state can be achieved between multiple parties.

From this design the whole ecosystem can gain on multiple fronts. Staking $EGLD will result in a stable yield thus validators will have a source of stable income. The new Sovereign Shards will bring more usage and more fees to both SovereignShard validators and to the mainnet as well. Enhanced composability will mean that most of the dApps on the mainnet will be as a central focal point for the sovereign shards. Validators/delegators will be able to earn additional rewards from fees accumulated on SovereignShards and from rewards of the second staked token. Any sovereign shard will start by default with a high trust. The design is opt-in for any project, not mandatory, as the freedom of building is of utmost importance.
