Why #MultiversX ?

When we say we are building/have built the best overall #blockchain , people get suspicious and they rarely read the next lines. In 2018-20, everyone said ElrondNetwork cannot build a sharded chain, as they are not a stellar team. Some stellar teams from back than have left the crypto space. But we delivered.

Now let enumerate a set of existing features, of the protocol only:
1. Decentralised network. >3200nodes. 2nd after ETH.
2. Secure. Provably secure, resolve theoretical and practical attack vectors. Acknowledged by auditors and researchers.
3. No downtime.
4. No shard takeover attack.
5. Scaling horizontally through sharding.
6. Super fast. 30K TPS in current setup.
7. No wallet drains.
8. ESDTs - the best token standard out there for Fungible, NonFungible, SemiFungible, DeFi assets, everything. Launch permissionlessly. These are native assets, as powerful as those but customisable.
9. Best composability. TransferAndExecute + BackTransfers. Every integration of a new contract and asset is easy.
10. SovereignChain SDK
11. SpaceVM - the fastest and most secure VM, running on top of WASM, provably fastest and with most OPCODES for builders
12. Integrated DNS on protocol level, Herotags.
13. Guardians - on-chain 2FA, a secondary key to protect your funds.
14. Asynchronous calls.
15. Cross shard transfers, execution, reverts, calls
16. Staking system.
17. Validator system.
18. Built in Delegation and Staking Provider system. >125K delegators.
19. Complete support for Liquid Staked assets, making those help decentralisation rather than centralisation.
20. On-chain governance
21.  TransferRoles for ESDTs and complex operations.
22. Composable tasks on-chain.
23. MultiTransfer and execute of assets.
24. Re-entrancy protection by design.
25. More than linear storage for ESDT assets.
26. No overflows. Integrated safeMath.
27. Integrated Crypto OPCODES on VM.
28. BigFloats, BigInts, BigDecimals.
29. No Sandwich attacks. Front-running and MEV protection.
30. Relayed Transactions.
31. Smart Accounts - data tries and multiple built in functions.
32. Generalised Paymaster Solutions.
33. Subscriptions. Web2 usability with web3 functionality.

Next in line - Vega Release:
1. StakingV4 - open markets for validators
2. MEV protection improvements
3. ReStaking for SovereignChains

Intermediate release:
1. ESDT V2 - dynamic ESDTs, best in class assets for games, tickets, dynamically evolving NFTs.
2. RelayedV3 - gasCost improvements, batching multiple TXs inside one relayed TX, multi user support
3. SECP256R1 crypto OPCODE - enables SC based Accounts which are controlled through passkeys from phones - complete Web2 experience in Web3.
4. BLSMultiSigVerifier
5. SovereignChain enhancements, special OPCODE for cross chain operations, seamless interoperability

Things to come:
1. Parallel execution - vertical scaling
2. 100K TPS
3. 3s blocks and 1s blocks
4. ConsensusV2 - more time for processing.
5. Finality improvements - same block finality
6. Reduction of cross shard processing time to 3s.
7. ZK everywhere. PI^2. Prove everything.
8. SovereignChains as interoperability layer. MultiVM setup with double settlements between different ecosystems. Ethereum, Bitcoin, Cosmos, Solana, Polygon and more.
9. AsyncV3.
10. Scaling the Merkle Tries or changing to new models.
11. Linear storage on the VM.
12. Dynamic Language Interpreter at VM.

Every point from here can be dissected and a lot can be written about it. A lot of features which others are dreaming of, they are already live on mainnet. And much more is developed in order to become the base layer of the Internet.

Explore, ask, create, add value.

p.s. most probably I have forgotten a few things and also this is protocol only. Haven't wrote about the hundreds of things coming for each of the other products.
