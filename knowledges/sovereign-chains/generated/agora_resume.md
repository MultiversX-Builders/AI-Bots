# General Economics for SovereignChains powered by EGLD

## Introduction

Sovereign Chains represent a modular and customizable architecture within the MultiversX ecosystem, designed to maintain decentralization, security, and composability from the outset. These chains leverage the SPoS (Secure Proof of Stake) consensus mechanism from the mainchain, employing similar validator rating systems and staking/delegation contracts.

## Core Concepts

- **Economic Trust**: Relies on stakeholders who invest financially, ensuring validators operate honestly due to the economic risks of malfeasance.
- **Decentralized Trust**: Achieved through a geographically dispersed network of independent operators.
- **Inclusion Trust**: Assumes validators will execute their duties as agreed upon with the consensus software.

## Challenges in PoS Networks

New PoS networks face difficulties like token volatility, securing initial stakes, and potential "death spirals" where a decrease in token value could diminish network security.

## Solutions Offered by Sovereign Chains

- **Programmatic Access to Security Features**: Allows Sovereign Chains to utilize the security and trust features of MultiversX as needed.
- **Dual-Staking Mechanism**: Combines staking of EGLD with a native token (if available) to stabilize the network against fluctuations in the native token's value.

## Economic Model and Parameters

Focus on promoting the growth and usage of EGLD while allowing flexibility within each Sovereign Chain. Establishes foundational economic security for new projects from inception.

## Staking Details

- **StakedEGLD Definition**: Users, validators, or chain creators can deposit EGLD into the SovereignChainStaking SmartContract. This is then delegated to mainnet contracts, earning yields.
- **Features of SovereignChainStaking Contract**:
  - Enables delegation to self or to a list of approved staking providers.
  - Supports the deposit of liquid staking tokens.
  - Ensures that locked funds are subject to slashing rules specific to the Sovereign Chain.

## Governance and Configuration

Initial parameters require a minimum of 1000 EGLD locked per Sovereign Chain, with 100 EGLD per validator node. The governance model allows for adjustments based on market conditions and the needs of specific sovereign shards through voting mechanisms.

## Integration with MultiversX

Sovereign Chains maintain connectivity with the main MultiversX ecosystem, handling data through a cross-chain processing module for settlements and ensuring data availability.

## Future Directions and Optimizations

Potential incorporation of ZK proofs and proof of proofs to enhance security and integration within the ecosystem. Continuous development and adaptation of the economic and security models to meet evolving needs and technological advances.

## Dual Yield Potential

The dual staking approach not only secures the network but also provides stable yields from both EGLD and any native tokens, thereby incentivizing further participation and growth in the ecosystem.

## Conclusion

Sovereign Chains aim to enhance the scalability, security, and economic robustness of blockchain networks, providing a flexible and sustainable foundation for future decentralized applications.
