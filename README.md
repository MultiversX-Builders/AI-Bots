# Multiversx Bots Knowledge base
Regroup information, tips, and instructions for generating a GPT agent dedicated to the MultiversX ecosystem


# Source of Information
It is important to diversify the sources of information and to cross-reference them.
We stil need to figure out the best way to do this, but a serie of scripts and tools will be developed to help us do this automatically.

Here are some sources of information that we have identified and that we will use to build our knowledge base.

## Stake Overflow
We would like to absorb and aggregate information from Stack Overflow to build the builders' knowledge base.

A script running periodically will search for posts related to MultiversX on Stack OverFlow and store them in a knowledge base.

For each post we will store the following information:

- Title
- Author
- Date
- Question Content
- Page Link
- List of answers
  - Author
  - Date
  - Response Content


## Telegram
We need to create a solution ( Probably a bot) that can be added to official and projects/Community groups to collect informations ( questions, answers, tips, etc) and store them in the knowledge base.

## X
We need to find a way to aggregate the revelant threads, either by regrouping informations by retweeting into a specific community from a group of selected users or maybe enter a direct link to a script/website that will then save the information in the knowledge base.

# User Question Management

For optimize our information aggregation, we need to educate the users on how asking question for optimzize the answers and the way processes will aggregate the information.



 - Regroup tweet that matter on the community group (Explicative )

Incentive peoples to post their questions on stack overflow (We need to assure presence on the forum to answer the questions)
